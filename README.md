# 6DOF-Robotic-Arm

Welcome to the 6DOF Stepper Motor Robotic Arm project! This open-source robotic arm is designed for precision and versatility, utilizing six NEMA stepper motors coupled with GT pulleys and belts to minimize backlash and improve motion accuracy. The arm is intended for automation, research, and educational applications, providing a highly customizable and scalable platform for robotic control.

High Precision – GT pulleys and belts significantly reduce backlash, ensuring smooth and repeatable movements.
- Stepper Motor Control – Driven by six NEMA stepper motors, offering precise positioning without the need for encoders.
- Modular Design – Easily adaptable for different payloads, grippers, and control architectures.
- Open-Source and Customizable – Designed for expansion, modification, and integration with various robotic frameworks.
- Multiple Control Options – Supports microcontrollers (ESP32, Arduino), stepper drivers (A4988, TMC2209), and CNC-based control systems.

This robotic arm is ideal for tasks such as pick-and-place operations, 3D printing, automated testing, and human-robot interaction. The project includes detailed documentation, CAD models, firmware, and software integration guides to help you build and control your own robotic arm.
